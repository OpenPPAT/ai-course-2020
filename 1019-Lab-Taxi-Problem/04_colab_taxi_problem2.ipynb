argmax. Argmax will return the index/action with the highest value for that state. Initially, our Q table will be all zeros. But, after every step, the Q values for state-action pairs will be updated.\n","\n","Second (#2): The agent then takes action and we store the future state as state2 (S t+1). This will allow the agent to compare the previous state to the new state.\n","\n","Third (#3): We update the state-action pair (St , At) for Q using the reward, and the max Q value for state2 (S t+1). This update is done using the action value formula (based upon the Bellman equation) and allows state-action pairs to be updated in a recursive fashion (based on future values).
